The resulting haze can travel as far as neighboring Malaysia and Singapore. \nConservation biologist Adam Kamal explains why palm oil is so ubiquitous: ""It is in almost everything: toothpaste, ice cream, cosmetic creams, and even in some fuels. No other crop produces the same amount of vegetable oil per acre that oil palm does."" However, while ""the productivity of well-maintained oil palm is amazing, the key issues now are the sustainable management of palm oil plantations, monocropping with heavy reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and expansion of plantations into pristine forest areas. High-quality forests are cut down for a one-off profit, which then eases the leasing of a clear-cut area for oil palm plantations. The key is to use already degraded land or land that aren’t primary forest or healthy secondary forest for these plantations as well as making sure that the supply chain is kept sustainable.""

The properties on either side of the road are private ranches that have been protected by perpetual conservation easements, funded by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and other partners. There was already a bridge at this site for cars and trucks to cross over a canal. By adding ledges to the sides of the canal (where TNC Conservation Projects Manager Wendy Mathews walks third photo) and high fencing on either side of the bridge, conservationists were able to encourage panthers to cross beneath the road rather than through traffic above. Vehicles kill nearly 30 Florida panthers on roads each year—the leading cause of death for the endangered puma. With the pictured segment of the statewide Florida Wildlife Corridor secure, panthers and other wildlife can now move safely from large public lands up to the southern banks of the Caloosahatchee River and the northern Everglades beyond. The Caloosahatchee had been a long-standing barrier to the northward movement of female panthers until late 2016, when the first female panthers were detected on the north side of the river in nearly 50 years. For Florida panthers to reach sustainable numbers, they need access to their historic territory in central and north Florida.

There was already a bridge at this site for cars and trucks to cross over a canal. By adding ledges to the sides of the canal (where TNC Conservation Projects Manager Wendy Mathews walks third photo) and high fencing on either side of the bridge, conservationists were able to encourage panthers to cross beneath the road rather than through traffic above. Vehicles kill nearly 30 Florida panthers on roads each year—the leading cause of death for the endangered puma. With the pictured segment of the statewide Florida Wildlife Corridor secure, panthers and other wildlife can now move safely from large public lands up to the southern banks of the Caloosahatchee River and the northern Everglades beyond. The Caloosahatchee had been a long-standing barrier to the northward movement of female panthers until late 2016, when the first female panthers were detected on the north side of the river in nearly 50 years. For Florida panthers to reach sustainable numbers, they need access to their historic territory in central and north Florida.

Often, when these women climb outdoors, local boys will throw stones at them, and many of them have been threatened by their own family members for participating in the sport. \nIn 2018 Ascend’s team attempted the unthinkable: to climb and summit the highest peak in Afghanistan, Mount Noshaq (24,580 feet), which had never been climbed by an Afghan woman. Hanifa, shown in the following photos, became her nation’s first woman to complete the historic feat. Says Hanifa: “I did this for every Afghan woman.” These images are part of the feature- length documentary film ""An Uphill Battle,"" set to release in 2021. #girlsarealsostrong #Afghangirls #getoutside #forceofnature #sheexplores\n\nNat Geo is celebrating women who fearlessly push boundaries and inspire the next generation of changemakers.

Every day girls face barriers to education caused by poverty, cultural norms and practices, poor infrastructure, violence, and fragility. But girls’ education goes beyond getting girls into school. It is also about ensuring that girls learn and feel safe while in school so they can complete all levels of education with the skills to effectively compete in the labor market. They must also learn the social-emotional and life skills necessary to navigate and adapt to a changing world make decisions about their own lives and contribute to their communities and the world.

Every day girls face barriers to education caused by poverty, cultural norms and practices, poor infrastructure, violence, and fragility. But girls’ education goes beyond getting girls into school. It is also about ensuring that girls learn and feel safe while in school so they can complete all levels of education with the skills to effectively compete in the labor market. They must also learn the social-emotional and life skills necessary to navigate and adapt to a changing world make decisions about their own lives and contribute to their communities and the world. According to UNESCO estimates, 130 million girls between the ages of six and 17 are out of school and 15 million girls of primary school age—half of them in sub-Saharan Africa—will never enter a classroom.

We learnt her story after months of our own recovery and my close call with death. Fekeetsa was left with a broken wrist after a buffalo hunt went wrong. It should have been a death sentence, but she had young cubs to feed and she wasn\'t going to give up on them. \nDespite undeniable pain, she changed her hunting strategy and searched the swamps for baby lechwe hidden in the reeds so she wouldn\'t have to chase them. Every day she went out with the excruciating injury, and every day she brought food back for her cubs, who grew stronger and bigger. Gradually she began to heal, although she will always limp. At the beginning of this year she even adopted a cub that had strayed from its own pride and gotten lost—a phenomenon that is unheard of among lions. \nToday Fekeetsa\'s cubs are nearing her size and she has recovered enough to broaden her hunts again.

Thunderstorms were drenching farms over in the next county, but here it was all late afternoon sunshine and lush crops. Ben’s ancestors came to this part of Iowa around Jesup for its rich soil, a gift handed down by ancient glaciers and millennia of prairie growth that built up fertile topsoil several feet deep. Much carbon from that soil has been lost in 150 years of farming.

They made a fabulous comeback when they received protection by mechanisms such as the Endangered Species Act, a crucial piece of legislation that has recently become endangered itself. Follow me @mitty and @SeaLegacy if you want to make a difference in the life of endangered species. #TurningTheTide #ExtinctionEndsHere #Expedition #ESA"" water humpback whale marine mammal sea whale grey whale ocean wildlife rock wave","['water', 'humpback', 'whale', 'marine', 'mammal', 'sea', 'whale', 'grey', 'whale', 'ocean', 'wildlife', 'rock', 'wave']",0.012502076104283333,0.012500055134296417,0.012500112876296043,0.17434634268283844,0.15046997368335724,0.012500768527388573,0.012501582503318787,0.5876771807670593,0.012501356191933155,0.012500562705099583

Scientists have recently confirmed that permafrost is thawing much faster than expected, releasing carbon gases that could drastically speed up climate change.' wilderness water resources water river sky lake reservoir recreation tourism bank","['wilderness', 'water', 'resources', 'water', 'river', 'sky', 'lake', 'reservoir', 'recreation', 'tourism', 'bank']",0.014286285266280174,0.014285804703831673,0.33935704827308655,0.014285804703831673,0.014289542101323605,0.014286825433373451,0.21836523711681366,0.34226706624031067,0.014290100894868374,0.014286303892731667

These young cats were measured and given immunity boosters while FP-224, which has repeatedly broken bones in vehicle collisions, was away from the den hunting. The previous year (second photo), two panther kittens were stranded when FP-224 was hit by a car near Naples. Biologists found the kittens, and the family was rehabilitated at White Oak Conservation Center. Here, the panther family is released.

Visit the link in my bio or nationalgeographic.com/animals to learn how new toll roads could block the panther’s path to recovery. I’ve been covering the story of the Florida panther for the past three years using custom-made camera traps through my Path of the Panther project with @insidenatgeo. The Florida panther is the last subpopulation of pumas surviving in the eastern United States. It has persevered because of its ability to live in the hurricane-battered swamps of the southern Everglades, where as few as 20 panthers survived the hunting and persecution that eliminated pumas everywhere east of the Mississippi River. It’s from these Everglades swamps that the panther has staged its recovery, and is beginning to reclaim its historic territory in the northern Everglades and beyond. Panthers need expansive territory. One panther's home range is up to 200 square miles—ten times the size of Manhattan. That makes the Florida panther an umbrella species, which means protecting habitat for one panther helps protect habitat for hundreds of other species. As shown in these photos, a Florida black bear, white egret, American alligator (with a giant salamander in its mouth), and coyote all share the same trails with the panther. To learn more about the different species, how these photos were made, and what happened when Hurricane Irma hit my camera traps a few days after this panther photo was captured, please visit @carltonward.
